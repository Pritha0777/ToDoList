#This file gives a detailed documentation/explanation of the code

1) Main:
- We start with "while True" to ensure that the loop repeats multiple times until the user exits the loop
- The list of actions that can be performed on the to-do list is then printed within the While loop, such 
that after every action the user is given the options to perform another action or exit.
- Further we add an if-elif-else loop giving the choice of actions that can be performed on the list

2) We assign a list/array of tasks under the variable name of "tasks"

3) Display:
- We define a function named "display" to display the contents of list
- initiate if condition --> if not "tasks" then the "tasks" list is empty
else --> printing to do list --> if the task["completed"] = True (in the 'completed' function) then 
the status is marked as DOne or else Not Done
- enumerate is used while looping through the "tasks" list to give the index and the element as a tuple 
pair as output.
- lastly it prints the index number, task and status.

4) Adding Task:
- We define a function named "add_task" to add the task in the list
- we create a tuple with keywords "task" and "completed", and values as "task_name" (task assigned in main)
 and "False" respectively
- Now we append this tuple in "tasks" list

5) Completed task:
- We define a function named "completed" to mark the task complete
- if the index of task provided by user when asked in main function is <= 1 but <= total number of tasks, 
we mark the task at that certain index --> completed = True
- index = task_number-1 as the list index starts from 0
if the index of task provided by user when asked in main function isn't within the range ask the user to
retype the valid number

6) Removing task:
- We define a function named "removed" to remove the task
- if the index of task provided by user when asked in main function is <= 1 but <= total number of tasks,
the task with that index number is popped from the list and printed
- index = task_number-1 as the list index starts from 0
if the index of task provided by user when asked in main function isn't within the range ask the user to
retype the valid number

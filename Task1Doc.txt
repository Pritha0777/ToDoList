#This file gives a detailed documentation/explanation of the code

1) Main:
- We start with "while True" to ensure that the loop repeats multiple times until the user exits the loop
- The list of actions that can be performed on the to-do list is then printed within the While loop, such 
that after every action the user is given the options to perform another action or exit.
